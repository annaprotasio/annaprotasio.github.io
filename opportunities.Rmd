Many people have helped me in my career and I want to be able to help you in yours. At the moment, my group cannot provide funding for students or postdocs (I am working on that though!). Having a training position within my group will help you gain experience in computational biology, bioinformatics, molecular and systems biology and parasitology. 

As a graduate student in my group, you will have to apply for [Graduate Admission](https://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/blpampbsc) through the University portal. Funding opposrtunitites are listed [here](https://www.graduate.study.cam.ac.uk/finance/funding-opportunities).

Some examples of available topics and the skills you will develop are:

- Repeat content of genomes
  - finding repeat and transposable elements in genomes 
  - genomic organisation
  - phylogeny and classification
  - expression and mechanisms of control

- Differential gene expression analyses
  - access next generation sequencing data from the web
  - quantification of gene expression
  - comparative analysis
  - time series
  
- Skills
  - bash/shell scripting
  - Perl/Python
  - R, RStudio
  

My main focus is on the **genomics and molecular biology of parasites** but I am open to work on other organisms if there is an interesting biological research question. 

If still interested, do [get in touch](mailto:avp25@cam.ac.uk) ... there is much data to be analysed!
